## How It Works

The mod manager uses an **overlay system**. Instead of modifying the game's original PAZ archives, it:

1. Reads the original compressed game files from `0008/`
2. Decompresses them (LZ4), applies your chosen mod patches, and recompresses
3. Writes the patched files into a new **overlay directory** (`0036/`)
4. Registers the overlay in `meta/0.pakgt` so the game loads patched files on top of originals

---

**Advantage:** The original game files remain untouched, making the modding process safer and easier to manage or remove.

## ❗️ Troubleshooting

| Problem                      | Solution                                      |
|------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| Manager doesn't detect game  | Manually select the game installation folder  |
| Mods not working             | Check JSON configuration and load order       |
| Game crashes after modding   | Disable mods one by one to find the conflict  |
| Antivirus warning            | Add the folder to exclusions                  |
